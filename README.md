# NoSQL-Database
Implemented a simple NoSQL Database with Java

Implemented some Mongo functionality in Java. It is loosely based on the existing MongoDB driver for Java (Links to an external site.). This driver is used to connect to an existing Mongo database in your Java applications. Instead of connecting to an existing Mongo database, this project will be in charge of managing the data - reading and writing JSON from disk.
